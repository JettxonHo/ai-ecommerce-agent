# Web Fast Lane workbench

This directory contains the MVP-0 React / Vite browser workbench. It uses
React Router Declarative Mode for `/tasks`, `/tasks/new` and stable
`/tasks/:taskId` deep links, TanStack Query for remote Task state, and the
generated OpenAPI client through a private Task gateway.

The current deterministic loop consumes the real local API: create a Task,
save pasted/TXT/Markdown input, run the scripted Facts → Insight → Positioning
→ Marketing Brief → Xiaohongshu Brief pipeline, make the bounded review
correction, confirm once, and download both current Markdown exports. The
Workbench also renders honest `insufficient_input` results and reloads saved
Task/input/result state. The representative real-backend Chromium path is
opt-in with `MVP0_RUN_REAL_BACKEND_E2E=1` and never calls a provider.

## Toolchain

- Node.js `24.18.0` and npm `11.16.0` (`.nvmrc` and `packageManager` are
  committed).
- React / React DOM `19.2.8`, Vite `8.2.1`, and React Router `8.3.0`.
- `openapi-typescript` `7.13.0` generates the committed API types, and
  `openapi-fetch` `0.17.0` is consumed only by the private client adapter.
- TypeScript `5.9.3`, Vitest `4.1.10`, jsdom `30.0.1`, Testing Library React
  `16.3.2`, user-event `14.6.3`, and Playwright `1.62.1`.

Install exactly from the lockfile:

```bash
npm ci
```

## Local commands

```bash
npm run dev           # http://127.0.0.1:5173 (strict port)
npm run preview       # http://127.0.0.1:4173 (strict port)
npm run format:check
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test:unit
npm run test:contract
npm run test:e2e
npm run build
npm run api:generate
npm run api:check
```

`src/api/generated/schema.d.ts` is generated from the repository OpenAPI
authority and must remain byte-identical after `npm run api:check`.

The development server proxies `/api` to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`; start the
complete local stack from the repository root with `./scripts/mvp0/demo`, or
run `npm run dev` here when an API is already listening. The contract tests
use an injected transport and the Chromium tests fail on page or console
errors. A real OpenAI smoke is a separate FL-2 gate and remains pending.
